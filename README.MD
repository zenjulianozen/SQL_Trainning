## SQL Training Repository

This repository contains personal exercises focused on:
- SQL normalization
- PostgreSQL usage
- Transactions and rollback
- Python integration with databases

The goal is to practice real-world data handling and backend workflows.

Scripts are organized following a market-standard data modeling workflow:
- 01_schema.sql: base table structures
- 02_seed.sql: raw data
- 03_normalization.sql: transformation/cleaning
- 04_constraints.sql: rules, foreign keys
- 05_views.sql: abstractions, data output ready to be used
